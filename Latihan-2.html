    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: medium; font-weight: thin; font-family: verdana;">In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/) is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Ini Heading 2</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: medium; font-weight: thin;">Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum ("pain itself").</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Ini Heading 3</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: medium; font-weight: thin;">Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: medium; font-weight: thin; color: red;">Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.[6]</p>
